# Bear Alfred Workflow

[Alfred 3 workflow](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) to search and create notes in [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/).

## Install
To install, download a released alfred-bear.alfredworkflow and double-click to open in Alfred 3. Easy-peasy.

## Searching and opening results 
- `bs` -- Search for a note by title and open it in Bear.
- `bst` -- Search for a tag (a group of notes) by tag title and open it in Bear.

## Creating a new note
- `bn` -- Create a new note with input as title. Tags optional.
	- `bn I love notes!` -- Creates a new note with the title and text "*I love notes!*"
	- `bn I love notes! #love #notes` -- Creates a new note with the title and text "*I love notes!*" and the tags "*#love*" and "*#notes*"

## Todo
- Append text to existing notes.
- Create release checklist like [this one](https://github.com/robwalton/alfred-ulysses-workflow/blob/master/release-checklist.md).
- Create release and all that.
- Make Github repo public.
- Figure out Packal and upload there.
